# Efficient-Data-Stream-Anomaly-Detection

# Explanation of Key Components
data_stream_generator: 
    Generates a continuous stream of data that combines trend, seasonality, and random noise, with occasional anomalies.
AnomalyDetector Class: 
    Implements a sliding window for real-time anomaly detection based on statistical deviation from the mean.
plot_real_time Function: 
    Plots the data stream and highlights anomalies in real-time, with output to both the plot and terminal.
    

# Key Aspects and Justifications for the Approach
Simplicity and Efficiency:
    Since the procedure only needs the mean and standard deviation of a comparatively tiny window of data points, it requires very little processing.
    Because it can handle high-frequency data streams with no latency, it is especially well-suited for real-time applications.
Adaptability to Concept Drift:
    The method can adjust to shifting data patterns (concept drift) over time by employing a sliding window, which continuously changes to reflect current data trends.
    In applications where the data stream may alter in response to variables like seasonal patterns or changes in the market, this flexibility is crucial.
Threshold-Based Anomaly Detection:
    Sensitivity can be controlled by the threshold, which is a multiple of the standard deviation. While a lower threshold is more sensitive to modest deviations, a higher threshold will only catch extreme outliers.
    

# Limitations
Seasonality Detection: 
    Unless the window size is adjusted for certain seasonal cycles, the sliding window may not be able to capture long-term seasonal trends, even though it can adjust to short-term fluctuations.
Static Threshold: 
    Not all data types may benefit from fixed thresholds. More intricate patterns may occasionally be found using adaptive thresholds or machine learning techniques (like Isolation Forest).

    
# Effectiveness
A reliable and portable method for identifying irregularities in data streams exhibiting fluctuating behaviour is the Z-score sliding window approach. It works particularly well in applications like fraud detection, server monitoring, and rapid-response financial analysis where the ability to quickly identify abrupt anomalies is more important than long-term trend correctness.
